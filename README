Welcome to CTRL.

Before compiling, check if you have at least
 - ocaml 4.05
 - camlidl 1.05

The following things may already be available on your machine:
 - gcc-c++ (provides g++ 4.4.4)
 - zlib-devel 
 - glibc-static 2.12-1(if you compile static)
 - libxslt-devel
 - libxml-devel

To compile, type

 $ make

To run the tool, type
 
 $ ./ctrl <file>

After successful compilation you can type

 $ make clean

to clean up compiled sources.

The website of the tool is http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/software/ctrl/
You can contact the author at Cynthia.Kop@uibk.ac.at
The supplied smt-solver is Z3, and can be downloaded (including source) at http://z3.codeplex.com/
It is also called by the script external, which may be modified accordingly.

Note:
In case you have an earlier Ocaml version, it might help to drop the Expand
constructor in the type Arg.spec (currently, lines 140 in util.mli and 46 of
argx.ml in the src/util/src directory).
