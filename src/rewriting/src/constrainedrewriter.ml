(* Reduces a constrained term (s, phi) at position p using one of the
rules in rulelist; if calc is true, then the result is calc-normalised
and if general is true, then the result is as general as possible.
Here, rulelist contains tuples (rule, rule_environment,
forbidden_variables, sub_allowed), where forbidden_variables is a list
of variables in rule_environment which should not be in the domain of
the substitution used, and should not be considered for simplification
of the constraint; sub_allowed is a function mapping pairs (x,term)
(where x is a variable in rule_environment) to true or false, with
false making it so gamma(x) <> term. Here, the choice for gamma(x)
with x in the left-hand side of the rule is not affected by either
forbidden_variables or sub_allowed *)
