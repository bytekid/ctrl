  (* main functionality: to have that s = t [phi], for every
  substitution that maps the acceptable variables of s and t to other
  acceptable variables and respects phi, and which does nothing else,
  we must have s gamma = t gamma.  We assume that "acceptable" means:
  this variable can only be filled in with a value in a respectful
  substitution.  We also assume that non-acceptable variables do not
  have this property, and may falsely conclude non-equivalence if this
  is violated.

  First, we get the equalities required for strong unification (as in
  matchem); if they don't unify strongly, they cannot be equivalent.
  To be equivalent, we require that phi => s = t is valid or,
  limiting interest to the logical symbols, that phi => <generated
  equality> is valid.  To be non-equivalent, phi \/ NOT equality must
  be satisfiable *)
